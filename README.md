I'm Alessandro, I'm 23 and I'm working on my master degree in computer science, I want to get involved in the field of cloud computing, distributed computing and high performance systems. 

<br>

I work on a lot of stuff and maybe half of it gets through.


In the meanwhile I'm working on the following projects:
<!--
  - <a href="https://github.com/S3gmentati0nFault/cloudy-notes">cloudy-notes</a> ☁️ <br>
    for my cloud computing course.
  -->

  <!--
  - <a href="https://github.com/S3gmentati0nFault/cloudy-notes">disk-utility</a> 💾 <br>
    a very useful (and essentially custom) utility I am creating to implement on a computer at my place to preserve the pictures we have taken over the years. I am trying to mimic a multithreaded approach and handling of the structure similar to the one used to keep <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-structured_merge-tree"> LSM trees </a> alive.

  <!--
  - <a href="https://github.com/S3gmentati0nFault/Rust-for-fun">rust-for-fun</a> ⚙️ <br>
    I'm trying to learn Rust by doing some project Euler challenges.

    Doing my spin of the material provided by Sebastiano Vigna for the course of Algoritmica Per Il Web at Unimi (2022/2023 edition)
  
  - Greenfield 🪴 <br>
    Which is the actual project of the DSP course and will be private until march 2024 because of plagiarism dispositions.

    - The Distributed and Pervasive Systems <a href="https://github.com/S3gmentati0nFault/lab-dsp">homework activities</a> 👩‍👩‍👧‍👦 <br>
  The activities revolve around REST services, multi-threaded systems and MQTT. I am trying to make the repository better by adding some documentation, working my way towards the final release.

In my spare time I play the bass (really badly) and work on my podcast (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@overhear173/videos">Overhear Podcast</a>).
