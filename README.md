I'm Alessandro, I'm 23 and I'm working on my master degree in computer science, I want to get involved in the field of cloud computing, distributed computing and high performance systems. 

<br>

I work on a lot of stuff and maybe half of it gets through. I'm currently trying to implement a simple coherent hashing system that I've heard about during my web algorithmics course.


In the meanwhile I'm working on the following university projects:

  - <a href="https://github.com/S3gmentati0nFault/cloudy-notes">cloudy-notes<\a> ☁️ <br>
    for my cloud computing course.
  
  - The Distributed and Pervasive Systems homework activities 👩‍👩‍👧‍👦 <br>
    The activities revolve around REST services, multi-threaded systems, MQTT (only god knows what that's supposed to be).
    
  - Greenfield 🪴 <br>
    Which is the actual project of the DSP course and will be private until march 2024 because of plagiarism dispositions.
    
In my spare time I play the bass (really badly) and work on my podcast (Overhear Podcast).
