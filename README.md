I'm Alessandro, I'm 24 and I'm working on my master degree in computer science, I am currently trying to divert my attention to the world of physics, started my thesis on the recognition of quench events with machine learning models (🤞).


On vacation! Leave me alone.

    a very useful (and essentially custom) utility I am creating to implement on a computer at my place to preserve the pictures we have taken over the years. I am trying to mimic a multithreaded approach and handling of the structure similar to the one used to keep <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-structured_merge-tree"> LSM trees </a> alive.

    Which is the actual project of the DSP course and will be private until march 2024 because of plagiarism dispositions.

  The activities revolve around REST services, multi-threaded systems and MQTT. I am trying to make the repository better by adding some documentation, working my way towards the final release.
